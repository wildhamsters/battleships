== How to run

To run the application, the user needs to :


* Compile and build application with `mvn package` command
* Run server-side with `java -jar target/battleships-x.x.x.jar` where x.x.x is the current version of the game. 
* Type in the web browser `http://localhost:8080/` to enjoy a well-made battleship game

== Requirements 

The application requires Java 17 and Maven 3.8.5 to run.

== Game rules 
At the moment, the game rules are simple. The user can choose one of 25 board fields to shoot enemy ships and try to sink them.

This is a work in progress, and the game's final version should look similar to the one described in the link below.
