To run the application the user need to :


* Compile and build application with `mvn package` command
* Run server side with `java -jar target/battleships-x.x.x.jar` where x.x.x is the current version of the game. 
* Type in the web browser `http://localhost:8080/` to enjoy a well made battleship game


== Requirements 

Application requires Java 17 and Maven 3.8.5 to run.


== Game rules 
At the moment game rules are simple. The user can choose one of 25 board fields to shoot enemy ships and try to sunk them.

This is work in progress and in final version the game should look similar to the one described in the link below.
